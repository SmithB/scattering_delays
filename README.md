Code for predicting the time delays for light that has scattered within granular media

There are two main groups of functions: The first generate the expected timing statistics of photons reflected by the scattering medium using Monte Carlo code.  The second interpret the Monte Carlo code to predict what altimetry waveforms returned from these media will look like.
